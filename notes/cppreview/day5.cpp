// notes for 9/24

// clock speed, ram speed is found in simple benchmark
// cache doesn't really work for write operations or lots of operations (it's small)

// in a cpu, there are transistors and cache
// multiple cpu cores (multiple cpus in one)
// there is a data bus (shared lines for lots of data to send over) to connect to the RAM and I/O
// there's also an address bus for setting the address to save data to
// 64 bit means 64 bits can be saved to one address
// ALU = arithmetic logic unit (for adding, subtracting, etc)
// arduinos are 8 bit
// R0 to R15 are the fastest on the pi (it takes one clock cycle to read all of them)
// FPGA = field programmable grid array
