## First steps

The first thing you need to do is get a 64 bit version of linux. I just got the raspberry pi 4 because it is faster, and more supported for 64 bit stuff. You can grab manjaro, but I decided to grab ubuntu because I also want to use this board for a ROS project that requires ubuntu 18.04. Anyway I followed [these instructions](https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-ubuntu-server-18-04-2-installation-guide/) and installed ubuntu on an ssd and on the sd card [this](https://github.com/TheRemote/Ubuntu-Server-raspi4-unofficial/releases). Then I edited the `cmdline.txt` file on the sd card to point to the ssd. Then I booted the raspberry pi and used [these instructions](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/98636) to get the wifi working.
